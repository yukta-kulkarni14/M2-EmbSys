# Automatic Floor Cleaner

# Description
* An Automatic floor cleaner embedded system is designed which can crawl throughout the room and can collect garbage and dust particles using vaccum pump mounted on this device. The controller is used to drive the motors and the
suction unit,  also a couple of sensors are used to avoid the obstacles present on the way. This design is
used for domestic and industrial purpose.

# Identifying Features
* Avoiding obstacles and path sensing using ultrasonic sesnor.
* Falling from stairs can be avoided by IR proximity sensor.
* Calculating obstacle distance.
* Various movement patterns of bot.
* Cleaning dust particles through vacuum tube.

# State of art/Research
Automatic floor cleaner plays an important role in our busy life, which cleans the house with single press button. This bot is very simple and cost effective when compared with comercial products and it is more compact and portable. Equipped with Ultrasonic and IR proximity sensor these two sesnors plays a major role ultrasonic sensor avoids obstacles untill cleaning operation is completed and IR proximity sensor avoids falling from stairs. Due to technological advancement in this new age, robotic vacuum cleaner cleans floors automatically without human intervention. This wonderful device maneuvers around table legs and corners of wherever it is vacuuming.

# Abstract
Automatic floor cleaner is compact robotic system which provides floor cleaning service in rooms, office reducing human intervension. Households of today are becoming smarter and more automated. Home automation delivers convenience and creates more time for people. It is cost effective and performs cleaning activity with more efficiency. Cleaning manually has human error, time consuming and labours involved in cleaning floor may not clean as good as a robotic system.
The cleaner will be a step for providing comfortable life by resolving problems in traditional floor cleaning methods. The purpose of this project is to construct a floor cleaner which will be fully automatic providing obstacle detection by ultrasonic sensor and avoiding the bot falling from staircase using IR sensor.The controller is used to drive the motors and the suction unit also a couple of sensors are used to avoid the obstacles. This can be useful in improving the lifestyle of mankind. Automatic floor cleaner is an automated machine that facilitates the user to keep their place clean and hygienic.
